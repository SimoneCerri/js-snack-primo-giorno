//Exercise 1
let number = 100;
console.log(number);

//Exercise 2
let PI = 3.14;
console.log(PI);

//Exercise 2/B
PI = 3.1416
console.log(PI) //I was expecting to see and error but nothing wrong apparently

//Exercise 2/C
let radius = 8;
let circle = (radius * PI * 2);
console.log(circle);

//Exercise 3
let name = ("Carlo");
name = ("Marco");
console.log(name); //as expected the name is changed, but js don't like the variable "name" ?

//Exercise 4
let temperature = 22.5;
console.log(temperature + 5);

//Exercise 5
/* 
3.14 is a decimal number (floating-point numbers).
100 is an integer.

``` In JavaScript, a number is a data type that represents a numeric value. Numbers can be either integers (whole numbers) or floating-point values (numbers with a decimal point).

An integer is a whole number that does not have a decimal point. For example, the numbers 1, 2, and 3 are all integers.

On the other hand, a floating-point number is a number that has a decimal point. For example, the numbers 1.1, 2.2, and 3.3 are all floating-point numbers.

In JavaScript, the Number data type is used to represent both integers and floating-point numbers. There is no separate data type for integers. However, there are several built-in functions that can be used to work with integers, such as Math.round() and Math.floor().

the main difference between a number and an integer in JavaScript is that an integer is a whole number without a decimal point, while a number can be either an integer or a floating-point value. ```
